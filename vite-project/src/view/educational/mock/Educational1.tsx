      name: " Benefits of Exercise During Pregnancy",
      text: "Regular exercise during pregnancy offers numerous benefits for both the mother and the baby. It helps improve cardiovascular health, strengthens muscles, reduces back pain, and can alleviate other common pregnancy discomforts such as swelling and constipation. Exercise can also boost mood, increase energy levels, and promote better sleep, all of which contribute to a healthier pregnancy experience. Additionally, staying active may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and excessive weight gain.",

      name: "Safe Exercises for Pregnant Women",
      text: "Not all exercises are suitable during pregnancy, but many safe options can help maintain fitness levels. Walking is a low-impact, gentle exercise that is easy to incorporate into daily routines. Swimming and water aerobics provide a full-body workout without putting stress on the joints. Prenatal yoga helps maintain flexibility, strengthen core muscles, and promote relaxation. Low-impact aerobics and stationary cycling are also good options, as they provide cardiovascular benefits without high impact. It is essential to avoid high-risk activities such as contact sports, heavy lifting, and exercises that involve lying flat on the back after the first trimester.",

      name: "Guidelines for Exercise Intensity and Frequency",
      text: "While exercising during pregnancy, it is important to maintain a safe intensity level and frequency. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week, such as brisk walking or swimming. This can be broken down into 30 minutes a day, five days a week. Pregnant women should listen to their bodies and avoid overexertion, staying within a comfortable range where they can talk without becoming breathless. Proper warm-up and cool-down sessions are also crucial to prevent injury and maintain flexibility.",

      name: "Managing Healthy Weight Gain During Pregnancy",
      text: "Weight gain is a normal and healthy part of pregnancy, but it is important to manage it appropriately to reduce the risk of complications. The recommended amount of weight gain varies based on the mother's pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI). For example, women with a normal BMI (18.5-24.9) should aim to gain 25-35 pounds (11-16 kg) during pregnancy, while those with a higher BMI (25-29.9) should aim for 15-25 pounds (7-11 kg). Managing weight through a balanced diet and regular exercise helps ensure healthy weight gain and supports fetal growth without increasing the risk of gestational diabetes, hypertension, or delivery complications.",

      name: "Tips for Staying Motivated to Exercise",
      text: "Staying motivated to exercise regularly during pregnancy can be challenging, especially with fatigue and other pregnancy symptoms. To maintain motivation, it can be helpful to set realistic and achievable fitness goals, such as going for a 20-minute walk three times a week. Finding a workout buddy or joining a prenatal exercise class can also provide social support and encouragement. Incorporating variety into the exercise routine and choosing enjoyable activities can make staying active more fun. Remembering the benefits of exercise for both the mother and baby can also serve as a strong motivation to stay consistent.",

Pregnant women should stop exercising and consult their healthcare provider if they experience warning signs such as dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, vaginal bleeding, uterine contractions, or fluid leakage. Women with certain medical conditions, such as heart disease, severe anemia, or pregnancy-related complications like preeclampsia or cervical issues, should seek guidance from their doctor before starting or continuing an exercise program.",
