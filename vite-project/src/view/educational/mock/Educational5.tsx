      name: "Increase Intake of Essential Nutrients",
      text: "During pregnancy, the need for certain nutrients increases significantly. Folic acid is one such nutrient, crucial for the development of the fetal neural tube, with a recommended daily intake of 400-800 micrograms. Iron is also essential to prevent anemia in pregnant women, with a daily recommendation of 27 milligrams. Calcium is vital for the development of the baby's bones and teeth, with a daily requirement of 1000 milligrams for pregnant women. Protein is fundamental for the development of fetal tissues and organs, with a suggested intake of about 70-100 grams per day for pregnant women.",

      name: "Choose a Variety of Foods",
      text: "A diverse diet is essential during pregnancy to ensure adequate nutrient intake. Pregnant women should include a range of foods in their daily meals, such as whole grains (like brown rice and whole wheat bread), fresh fruits and vegetables, high-quality proteins (such as chicken, fish, beans, and nuts), and low-fat dairy products (like milk and yogurt). A varied diet provides comprehensive nutrition and helps maintain good appetite and digestion for expectant mothers.",

    {
      name: "Avoid High-Risk Foods",
      text: "Certain foods should be avoided during pregnancy to protect the health of both the mother and the baby. For example, raw fish and meats (like sushi, sashimi, and undercooked meats) may contain harmful bacteria and parasites and should be avoided. Unpasteurized dairy products and undercooked eggs can also carry pathogens, so it's important to choose products that have been properly heated. Additionally, high-mercury fish (such as shark, swordfish, and king mackerel) should be avoided, as high mercury levels can negatively impact the baby's nervous system development.",
    },
    {
      name: "Limit Caffeine and Sugar Intake",
      text: "Excessive caffeine and sugar intake can have adverse effects on both the mother and the baby. It is recommended to limit caffeine intake to no more than 200 milligrams per day, which is about the amount in one cup of coffee. High caffeine intake may increase the risk of miscarriage, especially in early pregnancy. As for sugar, it is advisable to avoid excessive consumption of sugary foods and drinks, as a high-sugar diet can lead to rapid weight gain and increase the risk of gestational diabetes.",
    },
    {
      name: "Stay Hydrated",
      text: "Staying properly hydrated during pregnancy is crucial for both maternal and fetal health. Water helps maintain healthy cells and tissues, supports digestion and metabolism, and prevents constipation. Pregnant women should aim to drink at least 8-10 cups of water per day and adjust their intake as needed. Hydration can come from water, milk, juices, and soups, but it is important to monitor juice and sweetened beverage consumption to avoid excessive sugar intake.",
    },
    {
      name: " Consider Appropriate Supplements",
      text: "While a balanced diet typically provides most of the necessary nutrients, pregnant women may sometimes require additional supplements to meet specific needs. Under medical supervision, supplements such as folic acid, iron, and vitamin D may be considered to ensure adequate nutrient intake for both mother and baby. When choosing supplements, it is important to pay attention to product quality and dosage to avoid excessive intake.",
