      name: "Morning Sickness",
      text: "Morning sickness, characterized by nausea and vomiting, is a common discomfort during the first trimester of pregnancy. Although it's called morning sickness, it can occur at any time of the day. To manage morning sickness, pregnant women can try eating small, frequent meals throughout the day, avoiding strong odors or spicy foods, and staying hydrated by sipping water or ginger tea. Ginger and vitamin B6 supplements have also been found to help reduce nausea, but it's always best to consult a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement.",

      name: "Back Pain",
      text: "As the pregnancy progresses and the baby grows, back pain is a common issue due to the added weight and the shift in the center of gravity. Pregnant women can manage back pain by maintaining good posture, wearing supportive shoes, and using a maternity support belt. Engaging in prenatal exercises, such as yoga or swimming, can help strengthen the back muscles and improve flexibility. Applying heat or cold packs and practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing can also provide relief.",

    {
      name: "Heartburn and Indigestion",
      text: "Heartburn and indigestion are common during pregnancy due to hormonal changes that relax the digestive tract muscles, allowing stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus. To alleviate heartburn, pregnant women should avoid large meals, eat slowly, and avoid lying down immediately after eating. It is also advisable to avoid spicy, fatty, and acidic foods. Over-the-counter antacids can be used, but only after consulting a healthcare provider to ensure they are safe for pregnancy.",
    },
    {
      name: "Constipation",
      text: "Constipation is another common issue during pregnancy, often caused by hormonal changes that slow down the digestive system. To manage constipation, pregnant women should increase their intake of fiber-rich foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and drink plenty of water to stay hydrated. Regular physical activity, like walking, can also stimulate bowel movements. If constipation persists, a healthcare provider may recommend a gentle stool softener.",

    {
      name: "Swelling and Edema",
      text: "Many pregnant women experience swelling or edema, particularly in the legs, ankles, and feet, due to increased fluid retention and pressure from the growing uterus. To reduce swelling, it is important to avoid standing or sitting for long periods, elevate the legs whenever possible, and wear comfortable, supportive footwear. Drinking plenty of water and reducing salt intake can also help manage fluid retention. Compression stockings may also be beneficial for some women.",

      name: "Leg Cramps",
      text: "Leg cramps, especially at night, are a common discomfort during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. To alleviate leg cramps, pregnant women should stretch their calves before bed, stay hydrated, and engage in regular physical activity to keep muscles loose. Massaging the affected area or applying heat can also provide relief. Ensuring adequate intake of calcium and magnesium may help prevent leg cramps, but itâ€™s important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements.",

    {
      name: "Fatigue",
      text: "Fatigue is a common complaint throughout pregnancy, particularly in the first and third trimesters. Hormonal changes, the body's increased energy needs, and the physical toll of carrying extra weight can all contribute to feelings of tiredness. To manage fatigue, pregnant women should ensure they get plenty of rest and sleep, eat a balanced diet rich in iron and protein to prevent anemia, and engage in light, regular exercise to boost energy levels. Listening to the body's signals and taking breaks when needed is essential.",
