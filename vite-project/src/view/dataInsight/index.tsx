            Early antenatal care provides a broader range of birth method
            options, as evidenced by the data showing significant rates of both
            non-instrumental vaginal deliveries and cesarean sections. For women
            at higher risk of complications, like those from migrant
            backgrounds, starting antenatal care early can be crucial in
            managing risks and potentially avoiding more invasive interventions.
            Ensuring timely and high-quality antenatal care may help in
            detecting complications earlier and offer more choices for safer
            birth methods.

            Women who undergo cesarean sections generally have longer hospital
            stays and recovery times compared to those who have vaginal
            deliveries. Although cesarean sections are sometimes necessary and
            safe, they can involve extended healing and increased risks for both
            mother and baby. Understanding these factors helps in making
            informed delivery choices.
          </p>

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
          <p>
            Early antenatal care broadens birth method options, including the
            opportunity to choose a natural birth, which generally involves less
            harm to the mother and baby and supports faster recovery. While
            cesarean sections are sometimes necessary, they typically require
            longer hospital stays and recovery times. By starting antenatal care
            early, women can better manage risks and increase their chances of
            opting for a vaginal delivery, which often leads to safer and
            quicker recovery outcomes.
