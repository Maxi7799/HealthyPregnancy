# Project Objectives
“Healthy Pregnancy” is a Monash University Project aiming at making migrant pregnant women
aware of pregnancy risks. My team built a web app educates users about pregnancy risks through
textual and visualised content while collecting cultural background information to analyse risks and
provide personalised recommendations on food intake, exercise, and medical care.
